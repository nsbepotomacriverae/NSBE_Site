          <p class="lead">Girls EnGear is an exciting, new program presented by the National Society of Black Engineers Potomac River Professionals that shows girls how creative, stimulating and inventive science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) can be. 
            Engaging girls in STEM will help develop their confidence and skill in areas such as design and construction which can also lead to inspired career paths in the future. Bringing these types of opportunities to young girls in our community will help us share the importance of gaining knowledge and improving education after high school. 
            Most importantly, Girls EnGear explores different aspects of STEM disciplines allowing them to see how engineers are changing our world.
