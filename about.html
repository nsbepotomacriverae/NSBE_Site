          <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is NSBE?  <span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
          <p class="lead">The National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) is comprised of more than 270 chapters on college and university campuses, 
              75 Alumni Extension chapters nationwide and 75 Pre-College chapters. These chapters are geographically divided into six regions. 
              NSBE had its genesis at a national conference planned and hosted by the Society of Black Engineers at Purdue University in April 1975. 
              Black Engineering students from the United States and Canada attended the event. From this meeting of concerned students and educators, 
              NSBE was born. In 1976, NSBE was incorporated as a nonprofit organization in the State of Texas. NSBE also became recognized as a 
              tax-exempt organization under Section 501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Some of NSBE’s present activities include tutorial 
              programs, group study sessions, high school/junior high outreach programs, technical seminars and workshops, a national communications 
              network (NSBENET), two national magazines (NSBE Magazine and the NSBE Bridge), an internal newsletter, a professional newsletter \(The 
              Career Engineer, a supplement in the NSBE Magazine), resume books, career fairs, awards, banquets and an annual national convention.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading" id="altpositiontext">History of NSBE <span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
          <p class="lead">In 1971, two Purdue undergraduate students, Edward Barnette (now deceased) and Fred Cooper approached the dean of engineering at Purdue University with the concept of starting the Black Society of Engineers (BSE). They wanted to establish a student 
                organization to help improve the recruitment and retention of black engineering students. In the late 1960’s, a devastating 80 percent of the black freshmen entering the engineering program dropped out. The dean agreed to the idea and assigned the 
                only black faculty member on staff, Arthur J. Bond, as advisor. Barnett served as the first president of the BSE. The fledging group gained momentum in 1974, with the direction and encouragement of Bond and the active participation of the young men 
                whose destiny was to become the founders of NSBE. Now known as the “Chicago Six”, these men are Anthony Harris, Brian Harris, Stanley L. Kirtley, John W. Logan, Jr., Edward A. Coleman, and George A. Smith.
                Encouraged by their on-campus success, Anthony Harris, president of the Purdue chapter, wrote a letter to the presidents and deans of every accredited engineering program in the country (288), explained the Society of Black Engineers (SBE) concept 
                and asked them to identify black student leaders, organizations and faculty members who might support their efforts on a national basis. Approximately 80 schools responded. Many had similar Black student organizations with similar objectives. 
                A date was set for the first national meeting and 48 students representing 32 schools attended the event, held April 10-12, 1975. Harris also changed the organizations’ nomenclature from the BSE to the Society of Black Engineers (SBE).
                It was at that historic meeting through majority vote, that SBE became the National Society of Black Engineers. The familiar NSBE symbol “N” with lightning bolts was chosen and it remains a distinctively recognizable symbol representing 
                the premier technical organization for African American engineering students and professionals. NSBE was eventually incorporated in Texas, in 1976 as 501©3 non-profit organization. John Cason, also of Purdue, served as the first elected president 
                of NSBE. As the organization grew, Virginia Booth became the first female National Chairperson and the first to serve two terms 1978-1980. The torch symbolizes members’ everlasting, burning desire to achieve success in a competitive society and 
                positively affect the quality of life for all people. The lightening bolt represents the striking impact that will be felt by the society and industry due to the contributions and accomplishments made by the dedicated members of the National 
                Society of Black Engineers. NSBE has since grown from six to over 15,000 members and the annual meeting has blossomed into the Annual National Convention, hosting over 8,000 attendees. NSBE has 17 NSBE Jr. pre-college, 268 student and 
                50 alumni/technical professional chapters. Headquartered in Alexandria, Va., NSBE offers academic excellence programs, scholarships, leadership training, professional development and access to career opportunities for thousands of members annually. With over 2000 elected leadership positions, 12 regional conferences and an annual convention, NSBE provides opportunities for success that remain unmatched by any other organization.

          <p class="lead">Since 1975, the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) has become one of the largest student-run organizations in the world. 
                The formation of the National Society of Black Engineers Alumni Extension (NSBE AE) dates back to 1980, when NSBE national officers 
                presented a proposal to the organization to include an alumni sector in the organization. Although the Alumni Extension (AE) was not 
                accepted at that time, the effort initiated a multi-year process to create NSBE AE. A revised proposal reflecting the origins of the 
                current alumni infrastructure was developed in 1984, and formalized in 1985. At the 1985 NSBE national conference, the NSBE membership 
                approved the formation of an Alumni Task Force.  They were assembled to design NSBE AE by the 1988 NSBE national conference. During this 
                three-year period, the views of NSBE students and alumni from across the nation were articulated, leading to the derivation of the NSBE 
                AE Operating Guidelines. In March 1988, at the 14th Annual National NSBE Convention, the NSBE membership approved the proposal to include 
                the Alumni Extension as an operating entity of the National Society of Black Engineers. During the 1988-89 year, the AE focused on redefining
                their Operating Guidelines and developing regional infrastructures in accordance with these guidelines. This effort marked the final steps in 
                the formation of the Alumni Extension. The addition of the Alumni Extension to the overall NSBE structure not only promotes participation and 
                input from the professional engineering community, but also provides a mechanism for NSBE graduating seniors to continue their involvement with 
                the organization. in April 2013 the NSBE Alumni Extension name was changed to NSBE Professionals.  NSBE Professionals has grown to over 5,500 
                national and international members with over 50 local chapters across the world. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                The purpose of the NSBE Professionals is to support NSBE in a way that:
                – Develops and enhances NSBE Programs
                – Increases technical awareness
                – Encourages scholastic achievement
                – Stimulates enthusiasm in the Black engineering community in order to promote technical expertise, professionalism, and fellowship among Black engineers.
